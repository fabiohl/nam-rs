# Audio Fidelity Map — Off-Spec DSP Design Decisions

Every engineering decision in `nam-rs` that lies **outside the strict NAM model specification** and
influences audio fidelity, real-time (RT) safety, or user experience is catalogued here. For each factor:
what it is, whether it is mandatory or optional, the sonic and performance impact, and where to
find the implementation.

The NAM specification defines only: topology (WaveNet, LSTM, A2, ConvNet), stored weight values,
and the mathematical forward pass. Everything below is a `nam-rs` implementation choice — not part
of the `.nam` / `.namb` file format contract.

† Resampler quality (32-tap vs 64-tap) was evaluated and fixed to 64-tap HQ — see §4. Activation precision is exposed via CLI (`--activation fast|standard`) and CLAP (`PARAM_ACTIVATION=8`). Standard (exact-grade) is the universal production default across all model families.

---

## 1. Native f32 Weight Representation

**What it is.** All neural model weight matrices in `nam-rs` are stored and processed natively as `f32` vectors, matching the reference NAMCore engine (`Eigen::MatrixXf`/`VectorXf`).

**Rationale for removing weight compression.** An earlier optimization using half-precision (`f16c`/`bf16`) weight compression was evaluated and removed. Quantitative profiling confirmed that `f16c` decompression overhead on L1 cache outweighed any bandwidth benefits for LSTM models, while introducing artificial interop drift in recurrent models. Weights are loaded directly as `f32` across all model families.

**Implementation.** Weight loading and vector storage in [src/models/](/src/models/) (`set_weights.rs` and `model.rs` per architecture). Utility modules in [src/math/common/half.rs](/src/math/common/half.rs) are retained exclusively for benchmark and test reference.

---

## 2. Activation Precision — Standard (exact-grade) vs Fast (Padé)

**What it is.** Neural models rely on non-linear activations (`tanh`, `sigmoid`). `nam-rs` provides two approximation modes controlled via the global `ActivationPrecision` atomic flag in [src/math/activations/mod.rs](/src/math/activations/mod.rs):

| Mode                   | Activation Kernel                            | Max Absolute Error      | Approx Error (dBFS) | Compute Impact  |
|:---------------------- |:-------------------------------------------- |:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|
| **Fast** (opt-in)      | Padé [5,4] `tanh`, clamped \|x\| ≤ 4         | 2.32e-3                 | ≈ −53 dB            | Baseline        |
| **Fast** (opt-in)      | Minimax degree-17 sigmoid                    | 4.09e-4                 | ≈ −68 dB            | Baseline        |
| **Standard** (default) | Taylor-based `exp` kernels, degree-6 minimax | ~2.4e-7 (10,000× lower) | ≈ −133 dB           | +10–15% compute |

The Padé approximation clamp at `|x| > 4` introduces a derivative discontinuity that generates weak spectral aliasing at extreme gain settings. The minimax sigmoid has no clamp discontinuity, and the **Standard** kernels eliminate clamp discontinuities entirely.

### 2.1 Fast mode — opt-in for CPU-constrained setups

Exact scalar `f32::tanh` costs ~150 ns per 256-element AVX2 vector on x86-64. The Padé kernel runs in ~10 ns. For large WaveNet models processing hundreds of thousands of activations per 1.3 ms RT window, Fast mode (`--activation fast`) provides an explicit opt-in performance fallback for low-power CPUs.

**Deprecation Advisory for LSTM models:** In recurrent architectures (LSTM), activation errors accumulate feedback-wise in the hidden state vector $h_t$ over time. Under Fast (Padé) mode, LSTM gate errors compound to ~−13 to −29 dB SNR (~15.9–29.3 dB SNR vs reference), degrading quality to voice-through-a-wall levels. Because LSTM execution is dominated by GEMV operations rather than activation math, the 10–15% compute saving is negligible compared to the fidelity loss. The CLI emits a warning when `--activation fast` is combined with an LSTM architecture.

### 2.2 Standard mode — universal default

`ActivationPrecision::Standard` uses Taylor-based polynomial `exp` kernels for `tanh` and `sigmoid` (max error ≈ 2.4e-7, ~10,000× lower than Fast mode). It is active by default from engine startup across all model families (WaveNet A1/A2, ConvNet, Linear, LSTM).

Runtime switching is supported without audio thread allocation via CLI (`--activation standard|fast`) or CLAP (`PARAM_ACTIVATION=8`), with offline-render mode enforcing `Standard` automatically.

### 2.3 Interaction with Oversampling

Standard mode is most effective when paired with 4× neural stage oversampling (§5): oversampling suppresses non-linear folded harmonics via half-band filtering, while Standard exact-grade activations eliminate high-order polynomial folding residual errors.

**Implementation.** [src/math/activations/mod.rs](/src/math/activations/mod.rs), [src/math/activations/tanh/production.rs](/src/math/activations/tanh/production.rs) (Fast mode), [src/math/activations/tanh/high_fidelity.rs](/src/math/activations/tanh/high_fidelity.rs) (Standard mode), [src/math/activations/sigmoid/production.rs](/src/math/activations/sigmoid/production.rs) (Fast mode), [src/math/activations/sigmoid/high_fidelity.rs](/src/math/activations/sigmoid/high_fidelity.rs) (Standard mode).

## 3. LSTM Recurrent State Precision & Interop Parity

**Measured Interop Parity.** Under `ActivationPrecision::Standard`, recurrent state drift between `nam-rs` and reference NAMCore is eliminated across all LSTM model variants:

| Model                   | ESR vs NAMCore (Standard) | SNR vs NAMCore | ESR vs Ideal (f64 Oracle) | Status                   |
|:----------------------- |:-------------------------:|:--------------:|:-------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **BossLSTM-1×16**       | **8.50e-12**              | 110.7 dB       | **8.90e-13**              | ✅ Bit-identical interop |
| **BossLSTM-2×8**        | **1.00e-11**              | 110.0 dB       | **5.68e-13**              | ✅ Bit-identical interop |
| **Official lstm (H=3)** | **7.86e-13**              | 121.0 dB       | **2.71e-12**              | ✅ Bit-identical interop |

*Note: All values measured with 24,000-sample warm-up prewarm in canonical live mode (`docs/quality-contract.txt`).*

### 3.1 Steady-State Prewarm vs Cold-Start Decomposition

A critical distinction must be drawn between steady-state fidelity and cold-start unit testing:

1. **Canonical Steady-State (Prewarmed):** Measured after a 24,000-sample warmup period. In steady-state regime, `nam-rs` matches NAMCore to float32 precision limits (ESR ≈ 1e-11 to 1e-13, SNR 110–121 dB) and tracks the mathematical `f64` oracle to ESR ≈ 5.7e-13 to 2.7e-12.
2. **Cold-Start Decomposition (256 samples without prewarm):** Short-window tests (`test_decomposition_*` in `tests/parity/reference_oracle_f64.rs`) measure initial buffer-filling transients for architectures whose receptive field or recurrent memory exceeds 256 samples. These transient numbers reflect cold state initialization, not the steady-state precision floor. Consult [`docs/perceptual_validation.md`](perceptual_validation.md) §Decomposition Cold-Start for methodological details.

### 3.2 Key Recurrent Mitigations

Three core mechanisms maintain high recurrent precision in LSTMs:

- **Exact-Grade Gate Activations:** Exp-based polynomial kernels (~2.4e-7 error) across scalar, AVX2, and AVX-512 LSTM gate paths prevent error propagation in state vector $h_t$.
- **Kahan-Compensated Head Projection:** Head projection accumulation ($H \to 1$) uses Kahan compensated summation, yielding ~2 dB SNR gain in deep heads.
- **Fixed Delay Constraint (Oversampling Exclusion):** External oversampling is **not recommended** for LSTM models. Unlike feedforward WaveNet models, LSTM recurrent feedback delays are fixed in absolute sample counts — oversampling by 2×/4× shortens the physical time-constant window, altering timbre drastically.

**Implementation.** [src/models/lstm/layer_kernels.rs](/src/models/lstm/layer_kernels.rs).

## 4. Host Sample Rate Adaptation (Polyphase Sinc Resampler)

**What it is.** NAM models are trained at 48 kHz. When host DAW software operates at a different sample rate (e.g., 44.1 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 192 kHz), `nam-rs` performs rate conversion using a native minimum-phase polyphase FIR sinc resampler ([src/dsp/resampler/mod.rs](/src/dsp/resampler/mod.rs)).

**Configuration.** 256 phases × 64 taps, Kaiser window ($\beta = 12$), minimum-phase filter by default. A linear-phase variant is available internally for offline processing.

**Bypass path.** When `host_rate == 48 kHz`, a zero-cost bypass path forwards audio buffers directly without filter evaluation or memory copying.

**Performance & Quality Profile:**

| Metric                 | Value / Benchmark Result                                                              |
|:---------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Passband ripple        | < 0.05 dB (0 to 0.45 × Nyquist)                                                       |
| Stopband attenuation   | Filter design ≥ 105 dB; end-to-end multitone SNR ~31 dB (minimum-phase, gate ≥ 25 dB) |
| High-frequency rolloff | < 0.05 dB at 20 kHz (44.1 kHz host rate)                                              |
| Group delay            | Asymmetric minimum-phase response with minimal high-frequency dispersion              |

**Rejection of 32-tap mode.** A 32-tap resampler variant was benchmarked and discarded. While saving only ~40 ns per 64-sample block (< 0.1% total pipeline execution time), 32 taps degraded passband SNR from $\ge 100\text{ dB}$ down to $\sim 24\text{ dB}$. The 64-tap configuration is the permanent production standard.

**Implementation.** [src/dsp/resampler/mod.rs](/src/dsp/resampler/mod.rs), [src/dsp/sinc_kernel.rs](/src/dsp/sinc_kernel.rs).

## 5. Neural Stage Oversampling (HQ Mode)

**What it is.** Optional 2× or 4× oversampling surrounding neural model inference to suppress spectral aliasing generated by non-linear activations (`tanh`, `sigmoid`, `ReLU`). Based on Kahles, Esqueda & Välimäki (JAES 2019).

**Architecture.** Multi-stage half-band filtering using 25-tap Kaiser FIR filters ($\beta = 12$, >100 dB stopband attenuation). The half-band property zeros alternate coefficients, halving multiplication requirements.

Pipeline: `Upsample FIR stage(s) → Model Inference (at 2×/4× rate) → Downsample FIR stage(s)`.

| Mode          | Stages | Added Latency                                | Relative CPU Cost |
|:------------- |:------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Off (default) | 0      | 0 samples                                    | 1.0×              |
| 2×            | 1      | 12 samples @ native rate (~0.25 ms @ 48 kHz) | ~2.0× model cost  |
| 4×            | 2      | 24 samples @ native rate (~0.50 ms @ 48 kHz) | ~4.0× model cost  |

Latency is reported dynamically to the host host via `OversampleEngine::latency_samples()`. The CLAP plugin integrates latency announcements and dynamic updates seamlessly ([src/clap/processor/events.rs](/src/clap/processor/events.rs)).

**User Control:**

- CLI: `--oversample off|2x|4x` (alias `--os`)
- CLAP: Parameter ID=7 (stepped enum, state-persisted)
- Mode changes trigger lock-free SPSC garbage-collected engine rebuilds off the real-time thread.

**ADAA Rejection Rationale.** Antiderivative Anti-Aliasing (ADAA) requires analytical antiderivatives per activation function, conflicting with `nam-rs`'s generic SIMD dispatch macro (`dispatch_simd!`) and multi-architecture model dispatcher. Half-band FIR oversampling is activation-agnostic and universally compatible across all topologies.

**Implementation.** [src/dsp/oversample.rs](/src/dsp/oversample.rs) (`OversampleEngine`), [src/dsp/pipeline/stages/inference.rs](/src/dsp/pipeline/stages/inference.rs).

---

## 6. Denormal Prevention — Dither + FTZ/DAZ

**What it is.** Two complementary mechanisms prevent subnormal (denormal) floating-point numbers from entering neural network state buffers. Denormals cause microcode exceptions on x86-64 processors, causing 10–100× CPU execution spikes that break real-time guarantees.

### 6.1 Deterministic Dither Offset

A fixed offset `DENORMAL_DITHER_OFFSET = 1.0e-11` (−220 dBFS) is injected into input samples prior to inference and subtracted from output samples after inference ([src/dsp/pipeline/stages/input.rs](/src/dsp/pipeline/stages/input.rs), [src/dsp/pipeline/stages/output.rs](/src/dsp/pipeline/stages/output.rs)).

Because the exact same constant is added and subtracted symmetrically, cancellation is bit-exact with zero residual DC drift or noise floor elevation.

### 6.2 Hardware FTZ/DAZ (MXCSR Register)

The helper `set_daz_ftz()` in [src/math/common/ops.rs](/src/math/common/ops.rs) configures SSE2 MXCSR control register flags:

- **FTZ (Flush-To-Zero):** Output subnormals flush to positive zero.
- **DAZ (Denormals-Are-Zero):** Input subnormals are read as zero.

Applied on the first audio block of `process()` and refreshed every 1024 blocks to guard against host thread state resets. Active unconditionally with zero audible impact.

---

## 7. Adaptive Compute (Quality Fallback FSM)

**What it is.** When audio thread p99 block processing latency exceeds real-time safety thresholds (1.33 ms at 48 kHz / 64 samples), the Adaptive Compute finite state machine (FSM) downgrades model quality tiers (Full → Reduced → Minimal) to guarantee uninterrupted audio rendering.

**Transition Mechanics:**

- **WaveNet A1 Models:** Utilize double-pass inference during quality tier changes to crossfade smoothly between sub-models without click artifacts.
- **WaveNet A2 Models (A2-Full, A2-Lite, A2-Dyn):** Do not support layer-skip mechanisms required for double-pass inference. A2 architectures execute single-pass direct state transitions to preserve recurrent history integrity.

**User Control:**

- CLI: `--slim auto|full|lite`
- CLAP: Dedicated adaptive compute parameter. Setting `--slim full` disables dynamic fallback.

**Implementation.** [src/dsp/adaptive.rs](/src/dsp/adaptive.rs), [src/clap/processor/params.rs](/src/clap/processor/params.rs), [src/models/static_model.rs](/src/models/static_model.rs) (`supports_layer_skip()`).

## 8. Governance & Quality Contract Verification

All fidelity, SNR, and performance claims in this document are governed by the automated testing supply chain specified in [`tests/fixtures/README.md`](../tests/fixtures/README.md):

| Governance Layer                | Verification Mechanism                                                            | Enforcement Gate                 |
|:------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------- |
| **Layer 0 — Golden Generation** | `golden_gen_build.sh` + pinned reference commit (`1f42f88`, tag `v0.5.4`)         | Operational contract             |
| **Layer 1 — Pre-committed**     | `tests/golden_vectors.rs` — verifies Rust output against committed binary goldens | `utils/tests-quick.sh` (Phase 2) |
| **Layer 2 — Live Parity**       | `tests/parity/cpp_parity.rs` — cross-engine C++ parity execution                  | `utils/tests-long.sh`            |

**Freshness Manifest:** `tests/fixtures/.golden_manifest.sha256` is enforced as a hard gate by `utils/tests-quick.sh`.

Live dashboard measurements are updated via `utils/quality-dashboard.sh` and recorded in `docs/quality-contract.txt`.

## 9. Architectural Rationale Archive

Key technical trade-offs validated during `nam-rs` development:

- **Native f32 Weights:** Removal of f16c weight quantization eliminated L1 cache decompression overhead and restored bit-identical LSTM interop parity with NAMCore.
- **64-Tap Polyphase Resampler:** Benchmark analysis demonstrated that 32-tap filtering saved < 0.1% CPU (~40 ns/block) while causing catastrophic passband SNR degradation (~24 dB vs ≥100 dB).
- **Exact-Grade Activation Default:** Standard mode Taylor/minimax exp kernels cost +10–15% activation compute while delivering +89.5 dB average SNR improvement across LSTM models.
- **Half-Band FIR Oversampling:** Selected over Antiderivative Anti-Aliasing (ADAA) to maintain universal compatibility with polymorphically dispatched SIMD neural kernels.
