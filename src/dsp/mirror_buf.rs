//! # Mirrored Buffer (MirroredBuffer) via Mirrored Memory Mapping
//!
//! The `MirroredBuffer` is an advanced memory management technique that solves
//! the classic "contiguity break" problem in circular/delay-line buffers.
//!
//! ## The Problem: The Buffer Boundary
//! In traditional circular buffers, upon reaching the end of allocated space, the pointer
//! wraps back to the start. If a DSP algorithm (such as a Convolution or FFT) needs to read
//! a window of 1024 samples, but the pointer is only 500 samples from the end, the developer
//! would have to handle the read in two parts or perform an expensive copy (`copy_within`).
//! This introduces complex logic (`if/else`) and hurts performance in the "hot-path".
//!
//! ## The Solution: The Mirroring "Trick"
//! This structure leverages the processor's Memory Management Unit (MMU) features
//! to map the **same physical memory block** twice consecutively in the virtual
//! address space:
//!
//! ```text
//! Virtual Space: [ Physical Block (Page 0..N) ] [ Physical Block (Page 0..N) ]
//!                 ^                             ^
//!                 |                             |
//!          Buffer Start                    Mirror of the Start
//! ```
//!
//! Thanks to this mapping, any access that "goes past" the end of the first block will
//! automatically fall into the start of the second block — which is, physically, the buffer
//! start itself.
//!
//! ## Benefits for Real-Time Audio
//! 1. **Linear Access**: Algorithms can read contiguous windows of any size (up to the full buffer size) without worrying about "wrap".
//! 2. **Zero-Copy**: Eliminates the need to copy data to temporary buffers to linearize them.
//! 3. **SIMD Performance**: Enables vector instructions (AVX/SSE) to process data across the buffer boundary without logic interruptions.
//! 4. **Branch-Free**: Removes modulo (`%`) operations and `if` conditions, optimizing processor branch prediction.
//!
//! ## Huge Page Support
//! Attempts 2 MB huge pages (MAP_HUGETLB / MFD_HUGETLB) for the mirror buffer to reduce
//! TLB pressure in the DSP hot-path. Falls back to regular pages + `madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE)` + `MADV_COLLAPSE` (synchronous THP).
//! Status is tracked via `MIRROR_BUF_HUGEPAGE_STATE` global to avoid inflating the
//! struct layout (which would affect hot-path cache performance).
