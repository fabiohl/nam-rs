//! DeactivatedDspState — ownership of heavy DSP resources across activate cycles.
//!
//! When the host deactivates a plugin instance (mute track, bypass, UI close),
//! expensive resources — model weights, resampler polyphase coefficient banks,
//! oversampling half-band filter states, convolution FFT partitions — are moved
//! here instead of being dropped. On the next `activate()`, they are reinstalled
//! deterministically, avoiding I/O, filter-bank pre-compute, and FFT setup overhead.
//!
//! Validation on restore: `sample_rate` and `buffer_size` must match the current
//! audio configuration. If the host changed either, the affected resources are
//! discarded and rebuilt from scratch. Model weights are always reusable.
