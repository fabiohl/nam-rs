//! Finite state machine for the GUI window lifecycle.
//!
//! Implements the CLAP-spec-compliant state machine:
//! `Hidden → ShowRequested → Active → HideRequested → Hidden → Destroyed`
//!
//! This guarantees that the plugin:
//! - Never shows the window before the host calls `show()`.
//! - Never hides the window before the host calls `hide()`.
//! - Always notifies the host via `HostGui::closed()` when the user closes the window.
//! - Prevents invalid transitions (double-show, hide-before-activate, etc.).
