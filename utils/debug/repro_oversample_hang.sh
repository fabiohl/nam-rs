# repro_oversample_hang.sh — General-purpose safety wrapper for reproducing
# a suspected indefinite hang. Originally built to investigate and fix a
# real ELF symbol-interposition hang (see
# docs/postmortem-libm-symbol-interposition.md for the full writeup and the
# lessons learned) — kept as a general reusable tool for any future hang
# investigation, not specific to that one bug.
#
# This is a *debug/investigation* tool, deliberately NOT part of the official
# `utils/tests-*.sh` suite. It never runs unattended CI/nightly checks; it
# exists solely so a human operator (or an AI) can run a single reproduction
# candidate command with:
#   1. Resource isolation (systemd-run --user --scope + cgroup v2 limits), so a
#      runaway process cannot OOM/starve the host or crash the graphical session.
#   2. An aggressive external kill timeout, since the internal cargo/test-harness
#      timeout is known to be unreliable once a real hang is in play.
#   3. A durable, timestamped log + exit-code artifact under target/debug-logs/,
#      plus an automatic dmesg tail, so every attempt is fully reproducible and
#      post-mortem-able without relying on scrollback.
#
# Usage:
#   utils/debug/repro_oversample_hang.sh <timeout_seconds> <label> -- <cargo comando completo...>
#
# Example:
#   utils/debug/repro_oversample_hang.sh 15 varA-stable-debug -- \
#     cargo test --lib -- "dsp::oversample::oversample_test::test_x2_aliasing_rejection" \
#       --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
#
# Exit codes:
#   0        — command completed normally within the timeout (success or an
#              ordinary test failure/assertion; inspect the log for details).
#   128+N    — the whole cgroup was terminated by `RuntimeMaxSec` (systemd
#              sends SIGTERM=15 first, hence the near-universally observed
#              143; escalates to SIGKILL=9/137 if the process ignores TERM).
#              Treat ANY exit >= 128 as HANG/RESOURCE-KILL.
#   2        — usage error (bad arguments); never confuse this with the above.
#   other    — whatever the wrapped command itself returned (ordinary pass/fail).
#
# CRITICAL FIX (verified live during the investigation this tool was built
# for — see docs/postmortem-libm-symbol-interposition.md §2 for the general
# lesson): an earlier version of this script ran
# `timeout -s KILL "$TIMEOUT_S" "$@"` *inside* the systemd-run scope. This
# was PROVEN LIVE to leak the actual test binary as an orphaned, still-running
# process pinned at ~100% CPU *after* the script had already printed
# "exit 124" and returned control to the caller — `timeout` only reliably
# signals its own direct child (`cargo`), not the grandchild test binary that
# `cargo test` spawns, and the scope's default `KillMode=process` does not
# clean up the rest of the cgroup on its own. This is exactly the mechanism
# that must be assumed capable of exhausting host resources unattended if
# this script is ever run without someone watching `ps`/`systemctl` afterward.
#
# FIX: the timeout is now expressed as `-p RuntimeMaxSec=<N>` on the
# `systemd-run` scope itself (no inner `timeout` process at all). systemd
# enforces this by sending SIGTERM then SIGKILL to *every* process in the
# scope's cgroup — verified empirically to leave zero residual processes. Do
# not reintroduce an inner `timeout -s KILL` — it is the confirmed root
# cause of a real, reproduced-live orphan/resource leak, not a theoretical
# concern.
#
# Secondary fix retained from the previous revision: no `| tee` pipe for the
# authoritative exit-status capture (a `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` read after `tee`
# separately produced a false-negative exit 0 for a log truncated exactly
# like a confirmed hang). Output is redirected straight to the log file and
# `$?` is read immediately, unambiguously.
