//! Part of T3.3: formalizing the calibration infrastructure.

//! ## F10 Investigation (E2.1 — 2026-06-24)
//!
//! Fidelity Margin ≤ 0.5 dB in `live_cross_validation_lstm_dyn_1x7 (v2)`
//! and `live_cross_validation_linear (v2)` was investigated via `git bisect`
//! between current HEAD and pre-Épico-B commit `ff8a500` ("épico a concluido").
//!
//! **Result: PRE-EXISTENT.** The Fidelity Margin values (0.5, 0.4, -0.9, -0.8 dB)
//! are bit-identical between commits. They originate from golden_vectors tests
//! (WaveNet A2-Full/Lite and LSTM models) where SNR(anchor) — the C++ model's
//! own signal degradation — is close to the Rust/C++ parity SNR. The SIMD
//! kernel rewrites (Épicos B/C: fused dot-product accumulate, unified GEMV,
//! 1-div tanh) introduced zero regressão in Fidelity Margin.
//!
//! The cpp_parity tests originally cited (LSTM-Dyn 1×7 v2, Linear v2) show
//! Fidelity Margin > 40 dB at both commits. The actual low-margin entries
//! belong to the golden_vectors suite (WaveNet A2-Full/Lite, LSTM Official),
//! which were already at those values before Épico B.

///    are "rigid" enough to compensate (SNR ≥ 40 dB AND ESR < 0.1).
///    The A2 Full/Lite models intentionally set `mse_limit = 1e30`
///    because their ESR gates are ultra-strict (≤ 8e-8), making
///    MSE redundant.
/// 4. `mrstft_max ≥ 0.5` → MR-STFT gate is neutralized (never catches
///    spectral regressions). MR-STFT is a relative metric bounded [0,1];
///    a threshold ≥ 0.5 would allow severe spectral divergence.
///    (Tarefa 3.1, F-2)

/// ## Principle: "todo golden pode falhar"

/// A golden test **must** be able to fail — that is the whole point
/// of a gate. A self-golden (output validated against itself) and a
/// neutralized threshold (SNR ≤ 0, ESR ≥ 1, or MSE ≥ 1e29 without
/// rigid SNR+ESR) are **not gates** — they are placebos that grant
/// a false sense of confidence.
